You need Python 3 with Cryptodome and tkinter installed. Cryptodome module installs as pycryptodomex. 

You need your peer in the same LAN (or VPN, but those still sometimes mess the packets). 

Add 'public' and 'keys' directories to your working directory (where you keep Window.py and Klient.py).

Fire up Klient.py. Log in. Remember your login and password! You will recieve no warning if you mess it up later - that's part of the security.  

Share the public.pem file with your peer. It should be generated in your working directory. Put you friend's public.pem file in your 'public' directory. 

Now you can login again. Set your peer's IP and port. You can start messaging.
